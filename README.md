# OmegaPoint-Assignment

Greetings, candidate!



For this programming assignment, we want you to implement an API for storing PDF files. In order to fulfill this assignment, we want your fully functional solution to:

* Provide an API to which PDF files can be uploaded.

* Validate that an uploaded file is a PDF file.

* Validate that the uploaded file is max 2MB in size.

* Persist uploaded PDF-files in a simple manner. In-memory storage is OK.

* Validate that a file has not already been uploaded. Files are considered as duplicates if they have the same name and same checksum.

* Allow uploaded PDF-files to be downloaded through another endpoint.

# Some constraints to consider:

Your provided API should be RESTful

If you implement your solution using C#, please use .NET Core.

If you implement your solution using Java, please use Spring Boot.

When reviewing your submitted solution, we will consider technical correctness, code quality as well as performance/scalability.

Please submit your solution in a way you deem fit. A Link to a GitHub Repository is preferred.

Good luck!
